        <p> First Major Group Project accomplished within 8 days of code work. </p>
        <p> Technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQUery, AJAX, and Firebase. </p>

        <p> Description: The main feature of our app is to build a list for travellers and locals to utilize for their trip. Date and destination are pre-selected to pull data from the Weather API to assist the user in planning their activities for the day. User gets to do a broad search for an activity (e.g. museum) or specific search of their point of interest (e.g. ROM). With the Google API we have selected, users can also view the images and reviews for the event. Final output is to compile these lists for users to refer to as they depart. </p>
