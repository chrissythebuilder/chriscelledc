                <p> I have chosen to take a full stack coding bootcamp at University of Toronto, powered by Trilogy Education Services to fully understand the fundamentals of programming and building solutions-oriented applications. With a background in Human Resources, I would like to combine my understanding of the workforce, specifically in the recruitment space and combine it with my progressing knowledge of how computers can change the future. </p>
                <p> I am in the quest of evolving digital experiences of users through building user-friendly, eye-catching, and dynamic applications. With vast and diverse exposure to client-facing roles from sales to recruitment to HR and an athletic background with a twist of artsy-ness, I am ecstatic to jump into a collaborative goal-driven team that could allow me to impact a bigger vision while allowing me to strive for more JS-power.</p>

            <p> Technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQUery, AJAX, and Firebase </p>
            <p> Description: The main feature of our app is to build a list for travellers and locals to utilize for their trip. Date and destination are pre-selected to pull data from the Weather API to assist the user in planning their activities for the day. User gets to do a broad search for an activity (e.g. museum) or specific search of their point of interest (e.g. ROM). With the Google API we have selected, users can also view the images and reviews for the event. Final output is to compile these lists for users to refer to as they depart. </p>

            <p> Technologies Used: HTML, CSS, jQuery, JS</p>
            <p> Description: Built a timed trivia game where the user only has 120 seconds to answer 10 questions. The user can only select one answer for each question and once finished, the submit button must be selected where the user is brought to a page where it shows his/her score. If the user did not finish on time then the test will automatically stop to bring him/her to the score page. </p>

Each crystal on the page has a random number attached to it so the user has to figure out what the value of each crystal is to help them get to the score they desire to attain. If the score matches, the user gets a winning point and if the user exceeds the random number then the user gets a losing point. </p>
