                <p> I have chosen to take a full stack coding bootcamp at University of Toronto, powered by Trilogy Education Services to fully understand the fundamentals of programming and building solutions-oriented applications. With a background in Human Resources, I would like to combine my understanding of the workforce, specifically in the recruitment space and combine it with my progressing knowledge of how computers can change the future. </p>
                <p> I am in the quest of evolving digital experiences of users through building user-friendly, eye-catching, and dynamic applications. With vast and diverse exposure to client-facing roles from sales to recruitment to HR and an athletic background with a twist of artsy-ness, I am ecstatic to jump into a collaborative goal-driven team that could allow me to impact a bigger vision while allowing me to strive for more JS-power.</p>
                <p> <strong> Programming Skills: </strong> HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Node, Express, mySQL, AJAX, working with APIs, Firebase, Local Storage</p>
